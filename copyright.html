This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website https://handyed.co.uk, use our mobile application, and any other services we provide (collectively, the "Services").

1. Information We Collect
We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Services includes:

Personal Data
Personally identifiable information, such as your name, shipping address, email address, and telephone number, and demographic information, such as your age, gender, hometown, and interests, that you voluntarily give to us when you register with the Services, place an order, or when you choose to participate in various activities related to the Services (such as online chat and message boards).

Derivative Data

Financial Data
Financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e.g., valid credit card number, card brand, expiration date) that we may collect when you purchase, order, return, exchange, or request information about our services from the Services. We store only very limited, if any, financial information that we collect. Otherwise, all financial information is stored by our payment processor, and you are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions.

3. Disclosure of Your Information
We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:

By Law or to Protect Rights
If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.

Third-Party Service Providers
We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.

4. Security of Your Information
We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

5. Policy for Children
We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [contact email].

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
