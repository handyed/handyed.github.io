    <section id="terms" class="section">
      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our services and any agreements between you and <strong>Turos Ed</strong> for property maintenance work. By booking a service or requesting a quote you accept these Terms.</p>

      <h3>1. Services</h3>
      <p>We provide plumbing, electrical, painting, decorating, and general maintenance services. Exact services and deliverables are set out in the written quote or job sheet provided prior to starting work.</p>

      <h3>2. Quotes, estimates & acceptance</h3>
      <p>Quotes are valid for the period stated on the quote (typically 30 days) and may be subject to change if the job specification changes. Acceptance of a quote by the client forms a contract between the client and Turos Ed.</p>

      <h3>3. Payment</h3>
      <p>Payment terms will be specified on the invoice. Unless agreed otherwise, payment is due within 14 days of the invoice date. We may require a deposit for larger jobs. Late payments may incur interest and recovery costs.</p>

      <h3>4. Cancellations & access</h3>
      <p>Clients should provide reasonable access to the property at agreed times. Cancellation or rescheduling should be given as soon as possible. We reserve the right to charge for missed appointments where no reasonable notice is provided.</p>

      <h3>5. Subcontracting</h3>
      <p>We may use trusted subcontractors for specialist tasks. We remain responsible for the overall delivery of contracted services.</p>

      <h3>6. Warranties & liability</h3>
      <p>We will perform services with reasonable care and skill. Any defect claims must be notified within a reasonable time. To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability for direct loss is limited to the price paid for the services. We are not liable for indirect, special or consequential loss, loss of profit, loss of business, or loss of goodwill.</p>

      <h3>7. Health & safety</h3>
      <p>Clients must inform us of any health and safety hazards and provide a safe working environment. We comply with relevant health and safety regulations and hold appropriate insurance.</p>

      <h3>8. Intellectual property</h3>
      <p>All materials, plans and content we produce remain our intellectual property unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

      <h3>9. Governing law & disputes</h3>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any dispute will first be attempted to be resolved informally; if not resolved, disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>

      <h3>10. Changes to these terms</h3>
      <p>We may update these Terms and the Privacy Policy from time to time; changes take effect when posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
