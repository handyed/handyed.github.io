      </ul>

      <h3>13. Data Protection and Security</h3>

      <h3>15. Modifications to Services and Terms</h3>
      <p>NCHM reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time, with or without notice. We may modify these Terms by posting revised Terms on our website with an updated effective date. Material changes will be communicated via email or in-Service notification. Continued use of the Services after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

      <h3>16. Entire Agreement and Severability</h3>
      <p>These Terms, together with any Order Forms, constitute the entire agreement between you and NCHM regarding the Services and supersede all prior agreements and understandings. If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted that reflects our intent as closely as possible.</p>

      <h3>17. Assignment</h3>
      <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms without our prior written consent. NCHM may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets upon notice to you.</p>

      <h3>19. Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <p>In the event of any dispute, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve the matter through good faith negotiations. If the dispute cannot be resolved within 30 days, either party may pursue available legal remedies.</p>

      <h3>20. Force Majeure</h3>
      <p>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, governmental actions, or Internet service interruptions, provided that the affected party provides prompt notice and uses reasonable efforts to minimize the impact.</p>

      <h3>21. Notice</h3>
      <p>Notices under these Terms must be in writing and sent to the addresses specified in your account or Order Form. Email notices to <a href="mailto:turosoffice@gmail.com">turosoffice@gmail.com</a> are acceptable for routine communications but not for legal notices of termination or material breach.</p>

      <h3>22. Waiver</h3>
      <p>No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.</p>
